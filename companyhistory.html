<h3 style="font-family:Consolas; color:Blue; margin-bottom: -5px; margin-top: 30px">THE HISTORY OF THE CALICO CAT PANTS</h3>

<p>Our story begins in 2012 inside of the <a href="https://www.petsmart.com/stores/us/in/lafayette-store0508.html" target="_blank">West Lafayette PetSmart</a> (one of our partners). It was here where our company founder, Mitch Daniels, decided to adopt a cat. Days passed after Mitch took his new feline friend home, and he felt that the cat did not feel comfortable around him or his home. At that exact moment, an idea struck. Mitch went to work trying to make articles of comfortable clothing for his cat. After countless hours of making clothing of different styles and materials, he realized that pants increase the cat's happiness and relaxation. Knowing this truth, Mitch searched online to try and find more pants, but nothing was out there. That is when Mitch decided Calico Cat Pants needed to be created.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: -15px">Through all of the ups and downs of opening the business, Mitch wanted to uphold three core values:</p>
<ol>
<li> Provide <u>exceptional customer service</u> that none of our competitors can match.
<li> Invest a lot of resources in <u>constantly innovating</u> what we offer.
<li> Utilize <u>new technology</u> to ensure growth.
</ol>
